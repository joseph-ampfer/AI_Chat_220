  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 14, 2025</p>

  <p>Chat 220 is a fun, experimental AI project built by students for learning purposes. We take your privacy seriously, and here's how we handle your data:</p>

  <h2>Google Login</h2>
  <p>We use Google OAuth 2.0 for login. This allows us to authenticate you securely using your Google account. We only request basic profile information (your email address and name). We do not collect or access your Google Drive, calendar, or any other personal data.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your email address (used for login via Google or password-based signup)</li>
    <li>Your name (if provided via Google or during signup)</li>
    <li>Your chat history (stored so you can view past conversations)</li>
    <li>Content you post to our public chat feed</li>
    <li>Authentication data like a hashed password (for password-based accounts)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Email Verification</h2>
  <p>If you create an account using a password, we will send a verification email to confirm ownership of your address. This helps prevent spam and ensures the security of your account. We do not use your email for marketing or share it with third parties.</p>

  <h2>What We Don’t Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not share your data with third parties</li>
    <li>We do not sell your information</li>
    <li>We do not track you across the web</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hosting & Storage</h2>
  <p>Your data may be stored on services including MongoDB Atlas, AWS S3, and Google Cloud Platform, depending on the feature used. All access is secured.</p>

  <h2>Chat History</h2>
  <p>Your chat history is saved so you can revisit past conversations. This history is only accessible to you when you are logged in. If you choose to delete a chat, it is permanently removed from our database and cannot be recovered. We do not share private chat histories with others.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>Have questions or concerns? Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:josephampfer@gmail.com">chat220team@gmail.com</a></p>
  <p>If you'd like to delete your entire chat history or account, contact us at <a href="mailto:chat220team@gmail.com">chat220team@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <p>This site is built and maintained by students for learning purposes and may change or be taken down at any time.</p>
